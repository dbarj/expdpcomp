# expdpcomp

Starting in version 11g, Oracle added the parameter "COMPRESS=ALL" that helps in compressing the dump file generated, but still uses the internal mechanisms for compression without allowing the user to choose the best form of compression. It also requires you to have the Advanced Compression Option.

So, if you are in one of those scenarios, expdpcomp is right for you:
* You don't have Advanced Compression Option but want to compress your expdp dumps as they are created.
* You are using a version lower than Oracle 11g.
* You want to control better the compression method of your dump files (gzip/bzip/lzma/etc).

The expdpcomp script performs a parallel compression of the files generated by expdp dumps, doing efficiently as the pipe and using the parameter of maximum dump file size of the expdp, also taking advantage of the parallelism parameter.
